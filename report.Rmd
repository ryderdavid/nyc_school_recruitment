## ELL Recruitment
Question: If I want to to target and recruit ells, where would the most sensible places be to work on targeted recruitment?



```
{r echo = FALSE}
high_ell_schools_man_bx <- schools_demo_snapshot_1718 %>% 
  filter(pct_ell > quantile(.$pct_ell, 0.95)) %>% 
  filter(boro %in% c("X", "M")) %>% 
  .[, c("dbn", "school_name", "total_enrollment", "pct_ell")]

tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(nyc_area_zips, bbox = st_union(manhattan_sf, bronx_sf)) +
  tm_fill(col = "grey90") + 
  tm_shape(districts_demo_snapshot_1718, point.per = "feature") + 
  tm_borders() + 
  tm_fill(col = "pct_ell", title = "% ELL Enrollment, 2017-18", palette = "BuGn") +
  tm_text("school_dist") + 
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("left", "top")) + 
  tm_shape(high_ell_schools_man_bx)
```
